# 🏁 f1-race-analytics

This repository contains diverse data analysis and visualisation projects applied to Formula 1 racing. It is oriented to the exploration of patterns, race strategies, driver bahavior and comparative analysis using data science and machine learning tools.

## 🎯 Objective

Apply modern data science and data analysis in the context of Formula 1, with the purpose:
- Extract relevant insights from telemetry data, positions and tyre strategies.
- Clearly and effectively visualise the development of a race or a driver's performance.
- Develop skills applicable to highly demanding contexts such as professional motorsport.
